Anakin: YOU TURNED HER (Padme) AGAINST ME! 
Obi Wan: You have done that yourself. 
Anakin: YOU WILL NOT TAKE HER FROM ME! 
Obi Wan: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that. You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind until now.. until now you have become the very thing you've sworn to destroy. 
Anakin: Don't lecture me Obi Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought Peace, Freedom, Justice and Security to my new empire.
Obi Wan: Your new empire? 
Anakin: Don't make me kill you. 
Obi Wan: Anakin, my allegiance is to the republic-to democracy!

Anakin: If you're not with me, than you're my enemy. 
Obi Wan: Only a Sith deals in absolutes. I will do what I must. 
Anakin: You will try. flips and does lightsaber thingy epic music 5 minutes later 
Obi Wan: I have failed you, Anakin. I have failed you. 
Anakin: I should've known the jedi were planning to take over! 
Obi Wan: Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil! 
Anakin: From my point of view the jedi are evil! Obi Wan: Then you are lost! Anakin: This is the end for you, my master. 

Obi Wan: It's over, Anakin, I have the high ground! 
Anakin: You underestimate my power... 
Obi Wan: Don't try it. 
Anakin: AAAAAHH gets legs cut off 
Anakin:AAAAAAAHHH 
Obi Wan: YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE! IT WAS SAID THAT YOU WOULD DESTROY THE SITH, NOT JOIN THEM! YOU WERE TO BRING BALANCE TO THE FORCE NOT LEAVE IT IN DARKNESS! Anakin: AAAAAH I HATE YOU!!! Obi Wan: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you!
Anakin: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
