    <div class="subpage-content">
      <p><a href="https://www.ics.ac.th/" target="_blank">International Community School (ICS)</a> is conveniently located in the growing Bangna district of Bangkok, about halfway between the city center and Suvarnabhumi Airport. ICS is a private, non-profit Christian school that was first established in 1993. The Bangna campus was built in 2004.

        Since its establishment, ICS has maintained a tradition of quality education. Accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI), we offer an American system of education for age 4 through grade 12. As of 2023, ICS has an enrollment of over 1140 students, representing more than 30 different countries. The cultural diversity of our student body contributes to the quality of education enjoyed by our students.
        
        The strength of our school lies in our qualified staff and our commitment to students. The majority of our teachers are recruited from the United States and Canada. Students, families and faculty find ICS to be a caring community where community participation is encouraged. At our school, students are equipped within the classroom to function beyond the classroom.
        
        ICS's academic program is college preparatory and emphasizes community service and AP class enrollment. We presently require 40 hours of personal community service (PCS) as well as additional hours in our Serving-and-Learning-Together (SALT) trips each year. In addition, we offer 24 AP courses and continue to add to our offerings. Class rank for each student is based on a grade point average (GPA) that is weighted and cumulative for grades 9 through 12. The average GPA includes all courses taken at ICS.</p>
