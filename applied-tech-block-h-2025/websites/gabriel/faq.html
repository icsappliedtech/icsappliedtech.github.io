            <summary>What is HTML?</summary>
            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is CSS?</summary>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It works with a markup language (e.x. HTML) and makes the content styles and the presentation of the website.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is the main difference between HTML and CSS?</summary>
            <p>HTML is for coding and creating the actual content: the paragraphs, images, links, etc. CSS is for changing the style and visuals of that content: the alignment, colors, sizes, etc.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Why do we put CSS in a separate file?</summary>
            <p>Although it isn't necessary to have the CSS styles in a seperate file with the HTML, putting the CSS styles in a seperate file is a lot more convient as any changes to the styles we want to make is not only easy to find but also easy to change, as we only need to change the code in one document.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is the difference between an &lt;h1&gt; and a &lt;p&gt; tag?</summary>
            <p>An h1 tag represents a text in Heading 1, and programmers will often make this the biggest font size. A p tag represents a text in a paragraph, which is just normal text; programmers will often make this a smaller font size and a different font from the headings.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What does the 'alt' attribute do in an &lt;img&gt; tag?</summary>
            <p>It provides alternate text that will take the place of that image in the scenario that the image fails to be (or isn't) loaded or displayed.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>How do I link to another page?</summary>
            <p>We use an &lt;a&gt; tag and an "href=" attribute set to be able to put in a URL into content elements like text or containers, allowing users to click that element and be taken to the URL.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is the difference between a 'class' and an 'ID' in CSS?</summary>
            <p>Classes, denoted by a . before the class name, are used to group multiple HTML elements share the same, or a common, styling in CSS, like page containers and footers. IDs, denoted by a # before the ID name, are used to uniquely identify a single HTML element that only appears once each page.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is the difference between 'margin' and 'padding' in CSS?</summary>
            <p>Margin is the space outside an object’s or container’s border, separating it from other elements on the page. Padding is the added space within an element, between its actual content and its border</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>When should I use an &lt;ol&gt; instead of a &lt;ul&gt;?</summary>
            <p>&lt;ol&gt;, which denotes an ordered list, should be used if the order of the list items are significant, like for a schedule or instructions. &lt;ul&gt;, which denotes an unordered list, should be used if the order of the items are not important, and it is used for listing a series of items.</p>
