  <h1>About!</h1>
  <h5>Here's a little bit about myself.</h5>
  <p>My name is Cadie. I am 14 years old, and I just started High School. My family and I live in Bangkok, Thailand. My mom is from SriLanka, and my dad is from the United States, but I was born in Thailand and have lived here my whole life. There are five people in my family. I have one older sister, and one younger brother. My sister is 16. Her name is Jaya, and she is a sophomore. My brother is 12, His nam is Ezra, and he is in 7th grade. Both of my parents work at ICS. My dads name is Chris, and my moms name is Ro. The picture I added is from when me and some of my friends went to an Olivia Rodrigo concerta few months ago. I am the one in the middle.</p>
