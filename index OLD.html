            Hello, my name is Mr Jason. I teach business and technology classes at an international school in Thailand. The school's name is International Community School, or ICS for short. ICS consists of two campuses. The larger and older campus is located in the capital city of Bangkok. The newer and smaller campus is located in the North East province of Isaan in the city of Udon Thani. I teach at the Bangkok campus. <a href="https://www.ics.ac.th/" target="_blank">Click Here</a> for the Bangkok campus. Or, <a href="https://www.icsud.ac.th/" target="_blank">click here</a> for the Udon Thani campus.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because of the size of the school I will only share some details about the Bangkok campus, where I work. Below is some information I copied directly from the website.
        </p>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.ics.ac.th/who-we-are">
            <em><q>International Community School (ICS) is conveniently located in the growing Bangna district of Bangkok, about halfway between the city center and Suvarnabhumi airport. ICS is a private, non-profit Christian school that was first established in 1993. The Bangna campus was built in 2004.</q></em>

            <em><q>Since its establishment, ICS has maintained a tradition of quality education.
